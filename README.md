# Project: To-Do List Application

## Description:

Create a to-do list application using Python that allows users to manage their tasks. This project will focus on practicing list manipulation and basic user interaction.

## Project Requirements:

1. Initialize an empty to-do list.
2. Create a menu with the following options:
   - Display the to-do list.
   - Add a task to the to-do list.
   - Mark a task as completed.
   - Remove a task from the list.
   - Quit the application.
3. Implement functions for each menu option:
   - Display the to-do list: Show the tasks in the list with their corresponding indices.
   - Add a task: Prompt the user for a task and add it to the list.
   - Mark a task as completed: Prompt the user for the index of a task and mark it as completed.
   - Remove a task: Prompt the user for the index of a task and remove it from the list.
   - Quit: Exit the application.
4. Ensure that the user receives appropriate feedback for their actions, such as task addition, completion, or removal.
5. Continue displaying the menu until the user chooses to quit.
6. Optionally, extend the project with additional features, such as saving the to-do list to a file or clearing the entire list.
